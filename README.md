# comma connect

The web and mobile companion application for [openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot)

Try it with your openpilot device:
- **stable:** https://connect.comma.ai
- **latest:** https://latest.connect-d5y.pages.dev/

## Development
* Install bun: https://bun.sh/docs/installation
* Install dependencies: `bun install`
* Start dev server: `bun start`
* Demo mode: Navigate to `/demo` to test locally without a comma device.

API and useradmin URL roots can be overridden at build time with
`VITE_COMMA_URL_ROOT`, `VITE_ATHENA_URL_ROOT`, `VITE_BILLING_URL_ROOT`, and
`VITE_USERADMIN_URL_ROOT`. Docker Compose accepts the same variables.

### Video playback tests

`bun run test:browser` tests the production drive viewer, timeline, and controls
with a generated H.264/AAC HLS stream. Install FFmpeg (with libx264 and AAC) and
the browser engines first: `bunx playwright install chromium webkit`.

The suite covers pause, rapid seeks, audio discovery, Map playback, nonzero clip
loops, source replacement, and recovery from actual HTTP 404 responses for
manifests and media fragments. Fixtures are generated in a temporary directory
and served locally; an account or comma device is not needed. Chromium and
Android profiles run in CI. Desktop WebKit and iPhone profiles can also be run
locally. Browser profiles do not replace testing on physical iOS/Android devices
and installed PWAs.

## Contributing

* Use best practices
* Write test cases
* Keep files small and clean
* Use branches / pull requests to isolate work. Don't do work that can't be merged quickly, find ways to break it up

## Libraries Used
There's a ton of them, but these are worth mentioning because they sort of affect everything.

 * `React` - Object oriented components with basic lifecycle callbacks rendered by state and prop changes.
 * `Redux` - Sane formal *global* scope. This is not a replacement for component state, which is the best way to store local component level variables and trigger re-renders. Redux state is for global state that many unrelated components care about. No free-form editing, only specific pre-defined actions. [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) can be very helpful.
 * `@material-ui` - Lots of fully featured highly customizable components for building the UIs with. Theming system with global and per-component overrides of any CSS values.
 * `connected-react-router` - Mindlessly simple routing with convenient global access due to redux
